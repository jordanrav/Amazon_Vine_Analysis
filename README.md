# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

The primary objective of this project is to conduct a thorough analysis of reviews pertaining to a specific product category on the Amazon e-commerce platform. The aim is to investigate if there is any evidence of bias present in the reviews, specifically towards those that are favorable, from members of the Amazon Vine program, which is a program that pays select reviewers for their reviews. This research will provide valuable insights into the potential influence of paid reviews on consumer perception and decision-making.

## Results

Based on the analysis of the image provided, the following inferences can be made:
* The total number of reviewers in the Amazon Vine program is 4,291
* The total number of non-Vine reviewers is 1,781,706
* Of the most helpful reviewers in the Vine program, 48 (or 51%) gave the product a 5-star rating.
* Of the most helpful non-Vine reviewers, 15,663 (or 39%) gave the product a 5-star rating.

## Summary

Based on the results that we received, I can say that there is definitely a positive bias in the Vine Program. out of all the Vine Program members who voted, about 51% of their votes were 5 stars, if their were no bias than I believe that the percentage amount would be closer to the percentage amount of 5 star reviewers that were not apart of the vine program. One additional analysis that should be performed is measuring the total % amount of 5 star reviews from the Vine Program members even if their review was voted as most helpful to see if the positive bias still applies.
